- Api -> localhost:8003/swagger
- connect to DB -> localhost:1433 | user:sa | password:testuser123!
- logging -> localhost:5601 (you need set index as logstash-* by @timestamp AND product-* by @timestamp (after any perform request and It will create index as product automatically))

## How to setup via docker swarm:

```sh
$ cd /deploy/docker-swarm
$ sh setup.sh
$ docker service scale {service_name}={replica_num}
```
And open links below as ;
- Api -> 192.168.99.100,101,102:8003/swagger
- connect to DB -> 192.168.99.100,101,102:1433 | user:sa | password:testuser123!
